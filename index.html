<h1> Magpies and Swooping in Australia</h1>
</br>
<p style="font-size: large;">The Australian Magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen) is one of the most recognisable birds in Australia. They are extremely smart, capable of recognising up to 100 human faces, and are accomplished songbirds.</br> They are very common in Eastern Australia, and can be seen all over Victoria. Click on the months to see how sightings change over the year!</p>
<div id="vis1"></div>
</br>
<p style="font-size: large;">While magpies are extraordinary birds, they can be rather territorial at times. To protect their territory, they sometimes swoop at passers-by, which sometimes ends in injury. But what causes people to get swooped? Here's what some people were doing when <b>they</b> got swooped!</p>
<div id="vis2"></div>
</br>
<p style="font-size: large;">So most of the people that get swooped are cyclists!</br> It makes a lot of sense - if I whizzed by through your front yard, you probably also get a bit angry!</br> After that, people walking and playing are next. So you should still be careful, because some magpies are just a bit grumpy no matter how fast you go!</br> Usually magpies are known to give a few warning swoops, so if a magpie does try swooping you, make eye-contact (they know when they're being watched), and look for a big stick to carry.</p>
<p style="font-size: large;">Now we know <b>what</b> not to do, how do we know <b>when</b> not to do it?</p>
<div id="vis3"></div>
<p style="font-size: large;">As we can see, the overwhelming majority of attacks happen in Spring. Hover over the different chunks to find out which months are the most dangerous!</p>
<p style="font-size: large;">But when they do strike, just how bad is their bite? Let's find out!</p>
<div id="vis4"></div>

<p style="font-size: large;">And that's it! Hope you have fun! Magpies are usually pretty friendly, but now you know how not to get on their bad side!</p>
